######### SPRINT WEEK ONE ###############
  Hash function:
    Setting up the hashing text function was relatively simple and required a few lines of testing in the
    Functions_Module_WK1.py file, which took a small string and fed it through the defined function 
    hashText(). Some trial and error was required to hash the text, mainly not forgetting to convert the 
    text into a byte object first. 
    
  Reading and writing to a pickle file:
    Our first attempt at reading and writing to a file was a simplistic pickle function. There were little 
    to no troubles setting it out, testing code is provided in the Functions_Module_WK1.py. 
    
  Loading animation:
    This was a function just built for fun and acts as a transition and screen clearer between different
    menu options. Testing is provided in the Functions_Module_WK1.py. This will also test the 
    clearTerminal() function, but beware mac users! It doesn't really workfor you.
  
  menuFunction:
    This was implemented in the functions interface. The file Interface.py acts as the test code for it,
    where it brings together the whole program and readily is reused in different menu screens to        
    automatically include saving files.
    
  Importing from txt files
    After some consideration of the possibility a user may want to read something from a txt file, this
    function was implemented. Testing code is provided in the Functions_Module_WK1.py
