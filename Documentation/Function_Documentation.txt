Menu Function:
    Description:
        A function to produce an interface which a user can ointeract with. 
        Normally, the user will not interact with this function as it is coded in into the main     interface.  
    syntax: 
        - menuTitle needs to be a string, 
        - optionList needs to be a list,
        - list of Objects needs to be a list of student objects instantiated from student class.
        
importFile function:
    description: 
        A function that takes txt files, opens them, reads them (as a list) and then closes the file
        The content within the file is returned as a list. 
    syntax: 
        -  user input
        - must be given as a str
        - the name of the file must be given as the name excluding txt, for example. "test" and not 
        "test.txt".
        
new_student function:
    description:
        It is a function which creates a new student class and assigns the attributes. To be used in 
        the main interface.
    syntax:
        -   name, e, d and n are given as str but e, d, and n are stored as int.
        
open_student_database:
    Description:
        It will oben a file called "StudentData" containing all of the student objects.

    syntax:
        - No input is required for the function.

save_student_database:
    Description:
        Once changes have been made to the list of objects with student objects, this is considered
        the database and is saved back into the StudentData pickle file.
    Syntax:
     -listOfObjects must be the list that stores all of teh student objects.
 
 search_by_name:
    Description:
        This will be used to search for a student in the listOfObjects
        It is done by looking for a desired name attribute of every object in the list
        Quite inefficient and could possibly change over to a dictionary if needed.
    syntax: 
        - name must be given as a string, exactly as the name of the student object which was 
        instantiated.
        -listOfObjects is the temporary database of all the student objects when the interface is run.
        
####################Sprint week 3#####################   
gen_sig:
    Description:
        This is used to generate a signed message along with a given message, which can be used for 
        authentication purposes. The user's private key and n is used to encrypt a hashed message 
        and its padding with the hash function used specified.
    Syntax:
        - Message must be given as a string. STRING LONGER THAN 64 DIGITS IN LENGTH RUN THE RISK OF NOT
          ENCRYPTING AND DECRYPTING CORRECTLY.
        - d and n are to be given as integers in BASE 10.
        - A single string is outputted, with the message in front and the signature following. The 
          message and the signature are divided by 0x.

check_sig:
    Description:
        This takes the output from gen_sig, which may be sent to a recipient to verify the legitimacy
        of a message. The ouput from gen_sig is broken into a list with the original message, plus
        the signed message. Then, the signed message is decrypted and the padding taken to hash the 
        original message.
        Finally, the function returns whether or not the hashed original message and the hashed message
        from the signature. If they match it indicates that the message is legitimate.
    Syntax: 
        -   output message is given as string (should be <message>0x<encrypted signature>)
        -   The e and n values are to be given as integers in BASE 10
        -   This function will print both hashed messages, and verify whether they are identical.
        -   Will also print padding.
        
##### KEY GENERATION FOR RSA #########################################################


gen_key:
    Description:
        using installed module rsa, generates a public (e,n) and private (d,n) key in 128 bit and       
        returns it as a list of keys = [n key, d key, e key] 
    Syntax:
        No input required.
        Keys are returned in DECIMAL in a list like this: [n, d, e]
#################     
   
###unused/backup
gen_prime function:
    Description:
        A function that generates a list of prime numbers.
        It then saves a list of the prime numbers generated to a file named as 
        primes_<number of bits>bits, which is to be used when generating RSA keys.
    syntax: 
        - bits is to be given as an integer in base 10. 
        - it determines how many bits the prime numbers will have, by taking 2 to the power of bits 
          subtracting 1 and divded by 2. 2^((bits-1)/2)
        
 generate_key_with_custom_RSA_algorithm:
    Description:
        A function that generates keys manually using the file of prime numbers produced by the  
        gen_prime function. It uses the maths behind the RSA algorithm and applies it and returns
        the e, n and d values.
    Syntax: 
        - bits is given as int, but it will only be used to read the file which the prime numbers 
          are stored in.
        - It will return e, d and n as a tuple.

########   Classes    ##########

students():
    Description:
        A class which is used to instantiated student objects for storing keys, messages, ect.
    Attributes:
        name: str  pubkey: int(10)   privkey: int(10)  n: int(10)
        name is used to describe which object belongs to a user.
        the other attributes are used for RSA 
    Methods:
        - get_ methods: descriptor that follows get_ denotes the values which are returned.
        - edit_ methods: descriptor that follows edit_ denotes the keys which can be edited. Note that  
            new_key has to be given as an str which is stored as an int in base 10.
