    Your group will be required to deliver a 10 minute demonstration of your software, its functionality and how you can use it to perform the given tasks.

Week 1 (Aug 24th): 

    Develop a program to read text from the terminal and a file, to hash this text and store the hash as a hexadecimal in a file.
Plan:
Notes: use md5 hashing for now.

Coding ideas:
Creating a class of message, with attributes: text = " ", filename = "Not found", message_list = []
Possible methods: encode() - This basically hashes the text and then converts it hexadecimal
                  readFile() - This method is to retrieve a message from a file and then append it to message_list.
