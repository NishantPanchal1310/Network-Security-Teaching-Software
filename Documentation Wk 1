Deliverables

    Software fully documented and written in Python 3.
    Technical documentation, including installation instructions, libraries used,  and UML class diagrams.
    Details about what testing was done and what data was used.
    Your group will be required to deliver a 10 minute demonstration of your software, its functionality and how you can use it to perform the given tasks.

Week 1 (Aug 24th): Current build 1.0

    Develop a program to read text from the terminal and a file, to hash this text and store the hash as a hexadecimal in a file.
Plan:
Notes: -use md5 hashing for now.
       -Should we implement IO file read and write to plaintext?

Coding ideas:
Creating class Message, with attributes: text(str), filename(str), message_list = [], hashed_result(hex)
Possible methods: addText() - to add text if the class is created without text
                  hashMessage() - This basically hashes the text and then converts it hexadecimal then adds it as an attribute of message object.
                  readFilePk() - This method is to retrieve a message from a pickle file and then append it to message_list.
                  saveFilePk() - This takes the message_list and saves it to a pickle file
