    Your group will be required to deliver a 10 minute demonstration of your software, its functionality and how you can use it to perform the given tasks.
Week 1 (Aug 24th): Develop a program to read text from the terminal and a file, to hash this text and store the hash as a hexadecimal in a file.



Clear Terminal Function
    Description:
        Clear all prints on the terminal 
    Syntax:
        clearTerminal()

Loading Animation Function:
    Description:
        Creates a loading anmation in the terminal
    Syntax: 
        loadingAnimation(reduntant text, number of animation loops)
        - Reduntant text is text while will stay on screen
            - Has to be a string
            - For multiline support add \n in string where a new line is wanted to be created

        - Number of animation loops is the number of times the animations repeat. Remember, the more loops, the longer the animation.
            - Has to be a integer

Hashing Function:
    Description:
        Hashes text using the sha3-512 algorithm
    Syntax:
        hashText(text)
        - Text is the input text that needs to be hashed
            - Has to be a string
            - Variables are accepted as long as they contain a string
