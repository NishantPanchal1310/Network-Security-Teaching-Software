Clear Terminal Function
    Description:
        Clear all prints on the terminal.
    Syntax:
        clearTerminal()

Loading Animation Function:
    Description:
        Creates a loading anmation in the terminal.
    Syntax: 
        loadingAnimation(reduntant text, number of animation loops)
        - Reduntant text is text while will stay on screen.
            - Has to be a string.
            - For multiline support add \n in string where a new line is wanted to be created.
        - Number of animation loops is the number of times the animations repeat. Remember, the more loops, the longer the animation.
            - Has to be a integer

Hashing Function:
    Description:
        Hashes text using the sha3-512 algorithm.
    Syntax:
        hashText(text)
        - Text is the input text that needs to be hashed.
            - Has to be a string.
            - Variables are accepted as long as they contain a string.

Menu Function:
    Description:
        Print a menu and allow user select an option
    Syntax:
        var = menuFunction(menu title, [optionA, optionb, etc...])
        - The function must equal a variable as it return a option value.
        - Menu title is the title of the menu.
            - Enter None for no title
            - Must be string.
            - Can be variable which contain a string.
        - An list of option must be entered, even if it is just one value.
            - The list must only contain strings.
            
Read File Pickle:
    Description:
        tries to take a pickle file of a specified name and read the contents
        It will return the message within the pickle file, unless the files does not exist.
    Syntax:
        readFile(filename)
        - The filename is required for the function to go retrieve the file.
        - has to be string.
        - variables that are not string are converted to string anyway.
        
Save file Pickle:
    Description:
        Takes a given text and adds it to a given pickle file specified by filename.
     Syntax: 
        saveFile(text, filenmae)
        - both filename and text are to be given as string.
